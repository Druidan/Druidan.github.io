                <p>For a long time, throughout highschool and college, I more or less fell into the classes that caught my interests, particularly literature and history. 
                    Because of this focus, I ended up never really deciding what I truly wanted to <em>do</em> with my career, and just continued along the path that seemed 
                    most appropriate to the classes I had taken. Because of that, I became a teacher, as I felt I almost had to do because of my degrees and skill set. 
                    However, though I showed some ability in the feild, and accomplished quite a bit over three years as a full time teacher, I was never happy with it. I 
                    only realized this when a financial downturn at my school led to a reduction in forces -specifically my position- less than a week before the first class 
                    of the next semester.</p>
                <p>This led to a period of soul searching and part time jobs which culminated in a revelation. I wanted to be a programmer. Following this, I found myself a 
                    coding bootcamp at Northwestern University. From here I plan on gaining the skills and knowhow it will take to excell at this new path my life is taking. 
                    Let's get to it!</p>
