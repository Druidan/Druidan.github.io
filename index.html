                            Because of this focus, I ended up never really deciding what I truly wanted to do with my career, and just continued along the path that seemed 
                            most appropriate to the classes I had taken. </p>

                            Because of that, I became a teacher, as I felt I almost had to do because of my degrees and skill set. 
                            However, though I showed some ability in the feild, and accomplished quite a bit over three years as a full time teacher, I was never happy with it. I 
                            only realized this when a financial downturn at my school led to a reduction in forces -specifically my position- less than a week before the first class 
                            of the next semester.

                                coding bootcamp at Northwestern University. From here I plan on gaining the skills and knowhow it will take to excell at this new path my life is taking.
